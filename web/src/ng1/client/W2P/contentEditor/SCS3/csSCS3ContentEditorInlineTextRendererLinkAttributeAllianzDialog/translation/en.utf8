# You do not need to escape chars, e.g. just use Ã¼ directly.
# You can continue in the next line by adding an \ at the end of the line.
# Empty line are ignored, as line starting with #.
# To encode an =, do the following:
# key = this translation should contain an equal char \
#       = here it does
# The two lines above will contain as the right hand side the string:
# 'this translation should contain an equal char = here it does'
# To encode an \ at the end of a right hand side, use:
# login = test \\
#
# The first \ is kept while the second is used to include the next line into the rhs,
# so the string encoded is: 'test \'
# To encode the \ anywhere else in the string, you do not need to quote it.
